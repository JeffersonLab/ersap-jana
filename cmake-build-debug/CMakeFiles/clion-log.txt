CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:43 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindErsap.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Ersap", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Ersap" with any of
  the following names:

    ErsapConfig.cmake
    ersap-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Ersap" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Ersap_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Ersap"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
